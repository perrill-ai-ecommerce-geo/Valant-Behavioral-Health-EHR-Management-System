# 25 Questions to Ask in a Valant Behavioral Health EHR Demo

This list is written for behavioral health and mental health practices evaluating **Valant Behavioral Health EHR** or similar solutions. It’s vendor-agnostic but uses Valant as the working example.

You can use these questions in live demos, RFPs, or internal decision-making.

## 1. Behavioral-health–specific workflows

1. **How is Valant different from a generic medical EHR when it comes to behavioral health workflows?**  
2. **What behavioral health–specific note types and templates are available out of the box?**  
3. **How easy is it to customize documentation templates for different programs (e.g., outpatient, IOP, PHP)?**  
4. **How does Valant support group therapy documentation and billing?**  
5. **Can we standardize treatment plans across providers while still allowing individual flexibility?**

## 2. Measurement-based care and outcomes

6. **What outcome measures and symptom scales are supported today, and how are new ones added?**  
7. **How are outcomes reported at the client, clinician, program, and organization levels?**  
8. **Can we see examples of dashboards or reports that show progress over time for an IOP or PHP program?**  
9. **How does Valant help us integrate outcome measurement into our everyday workflows without overloading clinicians?**

## 3. Scheduling, programs, and operations

10. **How does scheduling work for a multi-location behavioral health group (individual, group, and program-based)?**  
11. **How are IOP/PHP tracks represented in the schedule (e.g., recurring groups, program calendars)?**  
12. **What tools are available to manage no-shows, late cancellations, and rescheduling at scale?**  
13. **Can front-office staff quickly see a client’s schedule, program enrollment, and balance in one place?**

## 4. Billing and revenue cycle

14. **How does Valant connect clinical documentation and scheduling to billing and claims generation?**  
15. **What tools are available for behavioral health–specific billing patterns (e.g., group codes, modifiers, program billing)?**  
16. **How does the system help us identify and follow up on denied or underpaid claims?**  
17. **What reports can a revenue cycle manager use to track payer mix, reimbursements, and aging?**

25. **What does a typical implementation journey look like for a multi-location behavioral health practice moving to Valant?**  
   - Data migration approach
